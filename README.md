# 🌌 Dark AI Assistant

Welcome, mortal. You’ve summoned **Dark AI Assistant** – a Streamlit-based creature forged in chaos and caffeinated despair.  
It doesn’t just chat – it greets you with mischief, drops motivational insults, and lets you download its ramblings for eternal shame.

## ✨ Features That Might Ruin Your Day

- 💬 **Multiple Conversations**  
  Because one chaotic relationship with AI isn’t enough.

- 🎭 **Custom Roles**  
  Make your AI a Python tutor, travel planner, or your imaginary friend who never shows up.

- 🎲 **Creative Controls**  
  Crank up **Temperature** and **Top-p** – make it a poet or a drunk uncle.

- 🌀 **Thinking Animation**  
  Watch “Dark Thinking…” while it secretly judges your life choices.

- 😈 **Funky Greetings**  
  Every new chat comes with a slightly concerning welcome message. (You’ve been warned.)

- 🔥 **Chaos Fuel Quotes**  
  Motivational one-liners from the abyss to keep you going (or not).

- 📥 **Download Replies**  
  Save AI responses as Markdown – because screenshots are for amateurs.

- 🕒 **Dashboard of Doom**  
  - Current time (tick-tock, you’re still here)  
  - Message count (look at you, oversharing again)  
  - Role preview (shorter than your attention span)  
  - Token bar (yes, it’s running out)  
  - Mood vibes (Morning ☕, Afternoon 🚀, Night 🌙 … or eternal void)
